    """
    This is my own implementation of MCTS. 

    The algoirhtm procedes as follows

    1. Given some root node we need to find the best action.
    2. We do this by statring at the root node, 
    3. From the root node we select some candidate state (by taking an action)
    4. Fromt the candidate state we simulate.
        4.1 moves are made during simluation according to some default policy (in the simplist case a unifrom distribution of moves. )
    5. The search tree is then reccursivly updated using backprop. 
    6. The selected node is then added to the search tree.

    There are four steps applied per serach iteration

    1. Selection: starting from the root node a child selection policiy is recursively applied to descend through the tree until the most "urgent" expandable node is reached. 
        1.1: A node is expandable if it is non-terminal and un-expanded children. 
    2. Expansion: One or more child nodes are added to expand the tree (according to available actions)
    3. Simulation: A simulation is run form the new nodes according to default polict to produce an outcome
    4. Backpropagation: The simlulation result it backpropagets through the selectd nodse to update their statistics


    Selection and expansion are combined into the "treepolicy method"
    The rollout/simluation is the "default" policy.
